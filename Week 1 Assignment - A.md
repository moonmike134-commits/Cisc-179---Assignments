## This is my Assignment 1 B
Without coding, what is the output of the following statement: print("127","0","0","1",sep=".")
The answer to this question is : 127.0.0.1 

## This is my Assignment 1 C
Identify a situation where you have to print data with flush=True and flush=False.
flush=True is used when you need output to appear immediately, such as progress bars, real-time logs, or terminal animations. flush=False (default) waits until the buffer is full or the program ends.

## This is my Assignment 1 D
By default, the flush is disabled but print() output behaves like flush=True. Which argument triggers the flush?
Python Automatically flushes output when the program ends, input is requested or newline buffer is filled

## Challenges 
The maint hing i had trouble with was proabbly due to the fact that i got confused on how to put this into a mark down. I ended up putting all the code inside of the python project app, and confusing Github with the two. 
The youtube video was helpful but i think i was just being silly and overthinking it.
